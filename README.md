August 2019 EKU RUG Challenge Solution in Python

This is my solution for the EKU R-User group mini Challenge for August 2019. For details of the challenge, see: https://ekuresearchanalysis.github.io/RUserGroup/MiniChallenge/2019-08/MiniChallenge.html

It's an R-User group, but this solution was created using Python 3.7.

To run the solution, download the .py and the .csv. The .py file opens the .csv file, and as long as both are saved in the same directory things should work.
You do not need the .r file - it simply created the csv file. Note: if you choose to run the r file, you'll need to correct the path.

You will need the following Python libraries installed: pandas, scipy, matplotlib. If you are using Anaconda, you should have them already.
